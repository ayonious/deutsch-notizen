### Spotify

1. NEUN Unnützes Wissen: This one is now my favorite. Its a very new podcast. But unfortunately they dont have much episodes.

2. Fest & Flauschig: Its the one of the most popular Podcast in Spotify on 2018 and and 2019! its a funny Podcast. Very fast and tough German perfect for C1 stage.

3. Die 100 Großen Fragen des Lebens: A nice discussion between some easy topics but with experts on those themes.
