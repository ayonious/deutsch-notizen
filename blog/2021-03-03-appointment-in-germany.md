If you want an appointment at the Bürgeramt you might have to wait months 🤦to go there and do registration. You might just forget by the time its time for your appointment. Waiting for such long time might affect many of your plans, for example if you want to show proof of your living in Germany you need to wait for this. Or if you are planning a vacation, or if you want to get your driving license this summer and not wait till next summer.

But there are some ways people in Germany use to get things done in Bürgeramt 😈. I heard these tricks only by asking people around. Let me show you how.

## 🥱 Goto Bürgeramt Early in the Morning

This is one way you can get it done fast. No appointment needed. Just make sure you reach a little early before the Bürgeramt opens at 8am. When you reach there maybe around 30–60 minutes before you will see a line of people waiting in front of Bürgeramt. These are all people without any appointments. This is a very well known trick that Germans would tell you.

This does not always has to be waiting for 2 months for appointment. If you are lucky you can get appointment in next 2 hours.

This is tricky but more comfortable for me as I don’t need to wait very early in the morning. To do this, first goto the website of Bürgeramt in Berlin and there is an option to search for option in whole Berlin. There you can see if there is anything available(there wont be anything most of the time). You can refresh this page around every 5 minutes and you will find available spots for very short time. Be fast to put your name and email address and your’e done.
Recently when trying multiple times the website blocks users for short time. And also there is a captcha code so that no one is trying automatically.
